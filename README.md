# ðŸ“„ Project Explanation

This documentation explains the code and the involved tables that are used to track the progress of training courses within a company from **2019 to 2024**. The purpose of the code is to analyze the course progress by determining which employees have completed courses and when, aggregating this information by organizational dimensions (such as department, address, and year of entry) and comparing performance over the years.
