## Overall Purpose

The overall objective of this code and its supporting tables is to:

- **Determine First Completions:**  
  Identify the first instance of course completion for each employee-course pair.

- **Create a Comprehensive Dataset:**  
  Generate a complete list of all possible employee-course combinations, indicating course completion status (1 for completed, 0 for pending).

- **Aggregate and Analyze Data:**  
  Group the data by relevant organizational dimensions (department, address, year of entry) to calculate key performance metrics.

## 游댌 Code Structure Overview

### 1. CTE `primeros_finalizados`

- **Purpose:**  
  Identify, for each combination of employee and course, the **first date** when the course was completed.

- **What It Does:**  
  - Selects data from the `finalizados` table.
  - Uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function partitioned by `id_empleado` and `id_curso`, ordering by `fecha_finalizacion` in ascending order.
  - Renames `fecha_finalizacion` as `primer_fecha` and assigns a sequential number to each record so that only the first completion (where the number is 1) is considered.



### 2. CTE `Datos`

- **Purpose:**  
  Generate a detailed dataset that includes every combination of employees and courses, indicating whether each course was completed or not.

- **What It Does:**  
  - **CROSS JOIN:** Combines the `empleados` and `cursos` tables to obtain all possible combinations.
  - **JOIN:** Merges data from the `puestos` table to add additional details (such as department).
  - **LEFT JOIN:** Connects with the `primeros_finalizados` CTE to determine if a course was completed, filtering to only consider the first occurrence (`Veces_finalizado = 1`).
  - **CASE Statement:** Assigns a numerical status:
    - `1` if the course was completed (i.e., a valid `primer_fecha` exists).
    - `0` if the course is pending (i.e., `primer_fecha` is NULL).
  - Extracts additional fields like the date and year of completion.

### 3. CTE `Datos_agrupados`

- **Purpose:**  
  Consolidate the detailed data by grouping it according to organizational dimensions such as **department**, **address**, and **year of entry**.

- **What It Does:**  
  - Groups data from `Datos` by `departamento`, `direccion`, and `a침o_ingreso`.
  - Sums the `Estatus` field to calculate the number of completed courses per group.
  - Uses a window function (combining `SUM` and `COUNT`) to compute the total number of courses evaluated for each employee across the groups.

### 4. Final Query

- **Purpose:**  
  Present the final report with aggregated data, including year-over-year comparisons.

- **What It Does:**  
  - Selects data from `Datos_agrupados`, including:
    - `departamento`
    - `direccion`
    - `a침o_ingreso`
    - `Completados` (total completed courses)
    - `Total` (total courses evaluated)
  - Utilizes the `LAG` window function to retrieve the previous year's `Completados` and `Total` values (based on `a침o_ingreso`) for each `departamento` and `direccion` combination.
  - Orders the final output by `departamento`, `direccion`, and `a침o_ingreso` for clear analysis.
